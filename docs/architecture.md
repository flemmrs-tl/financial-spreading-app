# Financial Spreading Application Architecture

## System Overview

The Financial Spreading Application follows a modern microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and resilience. The system is composed of several distinct services that communicate through well-defined APIs.

## Core Components

### Document Processing Service
- Handles document uploads
- Integrates with OCR technology
- Extracts raw financial data
- Classifies document types

### Financial Data Processing Service
- Normalizes financial data
- Maps to standardized chart of accounts
- Validates data consistency
- Handles time period adjustments

### Calculation Engine
- Computes financial ratios
- Generates trend analysis
- Provides industry comparison metrics
- Supports custom calculation templates

### API Gateway
- Manages authentication and authorization
- Routes requests to appropriate services
- Handles rate limiting and security policies
- Provides unified API for frontend applications

### User Interface
- Responsive web application
- Interactive data visualization
- Workflow management
- Report generation and export

## Data Flow

1. Users upload financial documents through the UI
2. Documents are processed by the Document Processing Service
3. Extracted data is sent to the Financial Data Processing Service
4. Normalized data is stored in the database
5. Calculation Engine processes the data to generate insights
6. Results are presented to users through the UI

## Technology Stack

*Specific technology choices will be defined as the project progresses.*

Potential options include:
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, or Java/Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for document storage
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/Azure/GCP
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI

## Security Considerations

- All services will implement OAuth 2.0/OIDC for authentication
- API endpoints will be secured with proper authorization
- Financial data will be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging will track all system activities
- Regular security assessments will be conducted
